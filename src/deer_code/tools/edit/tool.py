    A text editor tool supports view, create, str_replace, insert.

    - `view` again when you fail to perform `str_replace` or `insert`.
    - `create` can also be used to overwrite an existing file.
    - `str_replace` can also be used to delete text in the file.

    Args:
        command: One of "view", "create", "str_replace", "insert".
        path: The absolute path to the file. Only absolute paths are supported. Automatically create the directories if it doesn't exist.
        file_text: Only applies for the "create" command. The text to write to the file.
        view_range:
            Only applies for the "view" command.
            An array of two integers specifying the start and end line numbers to view.
            Line numbers are 1-indexed, and -1 for the end line means read to the end of the file.
        old_str: Only applies for the "str_replace" command. The text to replace (must match exactly, including whitespace and indentation).
        new_str: Only applies for the "str_replace" and "insert" commands. The new text to insert in place of the old text.
        insert_line: Only applies for the "insert" command. The line number after which to insert the text (0 for beginning of file).
