# 🦌 deer-code

A minimalist yet powerful AI coding agent that helps developers learn and build intelligent coding assistants. Built with Python and featuring a VSCode-like TUI interface, deer-code demonstrates how to create AI agents that can reason, plan, and act on code.

## 🚀 Quick Start

DeerCode is written in Python and designed to be easy to set up and use. Follow these steps to get started:

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended for dependency management)
- [langgraph-cli](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/cli) (for development and debugging)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaman2009/deer-code.git
   cd deer-code
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Copy the configuration template:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. **Edit `config.yaml` with your settings:**

```yaml
models:
  chat_model:
    model: 'gpt-5-2025-08-07'
    api_base: 'https://api.openai.com/v1'
    api_key: $OPENAI_API_KEY
    temperature: 0
    max_tokens: 8192
    extra_body:
      reasoning_effort: minimal # `minimal`, `low`, `medium` or `high`
  # Alternatively, uncomment the following section to use Doubao's model:
  #
  # chat_model:
  #   type: doubao
  #   model: 'doubao-seed-1-6-250615'
  #   api_base: 'https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3'
  #   api_key: $ARK_API_KEY
  #   temperature: 0
  #   max_tokens: 8192
  #   extra_body:
  #     thinking:
  #       type: auto
tools:
  mcp_servers:
    context7:
      transport: 'streamable_http'
      url: 'https://mcp.context7.com/mcp'
    # your_mcp_server:
    #   ...
```

### Running the Application

**Start deer-code:**
```bash
uv run -m deer_code.main "/path/to/your/developing/project"
```

**Development mode (with LangGraph CLI):**

First, change `env.PROJECT_ROOT` in `langgraph.json` file.

Then, run the following command:
```bash
make dev
```

Now, open the browser and navigate to `https://agentchat.vercel.app/?apiUrl=http://localhost:2024&assistantId=coding_agent` to chat with the agent.
